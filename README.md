# Calculator
The project was part of The Odin Project [Calculator](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator). This project was a bit trickier
than I originally thought. There was quite some difficulty in managing the state of the calculator. There were also some edge cases that needed to be 
considered such as users repeatedly pressing 0 to create something like 0000 as an entry. However, this project was a great way to sum up everything that
I have learnt and done in the Odin Project.
